## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project I improved my ability to:

- Use **flexbox** for centering elements
- Apply a custom font using `@font-face`
- Create reusable link/button styles with hover states
- Write cleaner semantic markup for accessibility

Example of applying custom fonts:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Inter Variable";
  src: url("assets/fonts/Inter-VariableFont_slnt,wght.ttf");
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects I’d like to focus more on:

- Improving responsiveness across devices

- Exploring CSS Grid for more complex layouts

- Adding small animations for hover/focus states

### Useful resources

- MDN CSS documentation (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

- [W3Schools HTML and CSS Tutorials] (https://www.w3schools.com)
